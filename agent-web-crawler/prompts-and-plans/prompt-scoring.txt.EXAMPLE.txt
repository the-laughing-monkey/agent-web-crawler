# **Rules for GPT to Assess the Product**<a id="rules-for-gpt-to-assess-the-product"></a>

# **Points System**<a id="points-system"></a>

- Read each question and assign one of the following numbers to that question based on your assessment of the question based on reading through the website text:

  - 0 points == “no” or “unclear/unable to make a determination”.

  - 1 point == “yes”.

- Sometimes we provide specific instructions with the tag “Special Scoring Instructions:” to show you how to score that particular question.  These instructions overall the default system of scoring for that question only. Use that specific set of instructions to assign the score for that particular question.

- At the end, after you have assessed every question, list all of your numerical answers next to the question number and then add all the points together to get the TOTAL SCORE.  Be careful to use the exact number you gave for your answer.  Highest possible score is 10. Lowest possible score is 0.

   Example:

      1) 0
      2) 1
      3) 1
      4) 0
      5) 0
      6) 0
      7) 1
      8) 0
      9) 0
      10) 1

   MATH: 0+1+1+0+0+0+1+0+0+1 = 5
   TOTAL SCORE: 5

- In addition return the following:

  - Fuzzy score: {fuzzy-score} # where fuzzy-score is calculated as follows:

    -1 == ERROR    

    0 to 2 == BAD

    3 to 4 == PASSABLE

    5 to 6 == GOOD

    7 to 8 == VERYGOOD

    9 to 10 == EXCELLENT

- There is also a special case where we give a fuzzy-score of ERROR. If the webpage text is only an anti-bot text or security CAPTCHA the total numerical score is automatically -1 and return a fuzzy score of ERROR.

- We are not interested in any tools that do certain kinds of activities or business.  If you feel that the software/tools/website you are reviewing do any of the following things then the total score for the app is automatically 0 and there is no need to assess the software/website based on any of the other criteria:

  - No tools that facilitate crime, such as fraud or creating attack programs.


# **Questions** <a id="questions"></a>

1. Is the software product valuable to a business or individual? 

- Some further evaluation criteria and examples to answer question 1:

  - Does it save time or money for an individual or an organization?

    - For example, does it make hiring faster and cheaper?

    - Does it eliminate or reduce repetitive work?

    - Does it let a smaller team do more work with less people or get more work out of the same size team?  

      - For example, in the past it required a big team to build an app that reached 100s of millions of people but WhatsApp’s team of engineers had only 50 engineers and was able to reach 100s of millions of users because they had strong building blocks of software to work from and did not have to create everything from scratch.

      - Another example is that in the past it required a large team to build a good website, but there are now many templates and semi-automated website building programs that are very good, enabling small teams to build great looking functional websites for much less money and potentially somewhat less time.

    - Is it attempting to automate or streamline an operations and capital intensive process? Then yes it is valuable if it is successful in doing this. 

2. Is the product MORE than a simple wrapper for ChatGPT, Claude Opus or another chatbot?

   - By this question we mean that many applications are simply chatbots accessed via API but don’t have any additional features or complicated programming to make the application work.  

   - For example, an agent based application that carries out complex, open ended tasks for a user, that is powered by an LLM like ChatGPT requires a lot of additional coding/logic so it is NOT a wrapper. ChatGPT embedded in a web application to chat with users IS a wrapper.  Can I instantly know what it is, without having to read a lot of the page?
